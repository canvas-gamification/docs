# Conditional Questions

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

These questions usually require Scanner input from the user and use the inputted values to conditionally change the output printed.

## Why is it hard to test this?

These types of questions not only require input values but also change the output based on the input, so multiple cases and multiple input values need to be handled.
## How do I test this?

- **Test Class**: Create a class that extends the `BaseTest` class.
- **Test Sentence**: Create the [`testSentence()`](/junit-framework/writing-tests.md#testsentence) method with the output format as an array of [`Clause`](/junit-framework/clauses/clauses.md) objects.
- **Setup Test Options**: For any test that takes in input, the test writer must specify two values available in the [`TestOption`](/junit-framework/input-tests/test-option.md) class. These options also include setting the default input.
- **Call Main**: Call the main method of the test class by implementing the [`runMain()`](/junit-framework/writing-tests.md#runmain) method.
- **Set up input cases**: Write input providers that are a stream of input values used to run the code with multiple input. Refer to [Parameterized Testing](/junit-framework/input-tests/parameterized-testing.md) for more information. Make an input provider for each case.
- **Inject Clauses**: Since the output changes, the test sentence needs to be modified. Add `PlaceHolder` clauses to the test sentence that will be replaced with the correct output based on the input case. See [Clause Injection](/junit-framework/input-tests/clause-injection.md) for more information.
- **Retrieve Values**: Retrieve output values based on the format. See [Retrieving Values](/junit-framework/retrieving-values.md) for more information.
- **Additional Tests**: Depending on the question, you may need to create additional tests to ensure values are calculated correctly.

## Example

Refer to [Sample Input Test with Injections](/junit-framework/input-tests/full-example.md#sample-test-with-clause-injection) for an example of how to write a test with conditionals.
